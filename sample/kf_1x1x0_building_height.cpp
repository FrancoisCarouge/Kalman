//! @details Assume that we would like to estimate the height of a building
//! using a very imprecise altimeter. We know for sure, that the building height
//! doesn’t change over time, at least during the short measurement process. The
//! true building height is 50 meters. The altimeter measurement error (standard
//! deviation) is 5 meters. The set of ten measurements is: 48.54m, 47.11m,
//! 55.01m, 55.15m, 49.89m, 40.85m, 46.72m, 50.05m, 51.27m, 49.95m.
