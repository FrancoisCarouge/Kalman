//! @brief Estimating the temperature of the liquid in a tank.

//! @copyright This example is transcribed from KalmanFilter.NET copyright Alex
//! Becker.
//!
//! @see https://www.kalmanfilter.net/kalman1d.html#ex6
//!
//! @details We would like to estimate the temperature of the liquid in a tank.
//! We assume that at steady state the liquid temperature is constant. However,
//! some fluctuations in the true liquid temperature are possible. We can
//! describe the system dynamics by the following equation: xn = T + wn where: T
//! is the constant temperature wn is a random process noise with variance q.
//! Let us assume a true temperature of 50 degrees Celsius. The measurements are
//! taken every 5 seconds. The true liquid temperature at the measurement points
//! is: 49.979°C, 50.025°C, 50°C, 50.003°C, 49.994°C, 50.002°C, 49.999°C,
//! 50.006°C, 49.998°C, and 49.991°C. The set of measurements is: 49.95°C,
//! 49.967°C, 50.1°C, 50.106°C, 49.992°C, 49.819°C, 49.933°C, 50.007°C,
//! 50.023°C, and 49.99°C.
